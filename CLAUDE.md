# Claude Code Guidelines

## Branching Strategy
For each change you make, you must create a new branch. After implementing changes, push them up and create a merge request (MR) to the develop branch.

## Development Workflow
1. Create a new branch for your changes
2. Implement the required modifications
3. Push the branch to remote
4. Create a merge request targeting the develop branch
